# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 18, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write the greatest common divisor in Python.

**Thoughts:** Haven't learned much; just do easy coding practice.  Most of my time is spent on reading in this session.

### Day 1: May 19, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write polynomial computation in Python

**Thoughts:** Take a lot of time to look up for Python syntax and features on Baidu(I live in China at the moment).  Learned to define class with __str__ as well as __eq__ methods.

### Day 2: May 20, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: n-grams and try to check spell correction based on just n-grams(kinda failure with various reasons in mind)

**Thoughts:** Just coding n-grams after reading Speech and Language Processing Third Edition draft Daniel Jurafsky Stanford University.  What I learn is how to use http client as well as data structures in collections.
