##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write the greatest common divisor in Python.

**Thoughts:** Haven't learned much; just do easy coding practice.  Most of my time is spent on reading in this session.

### Day 1: May 19, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write polynomial computation in Python

**Thoughts:** Take a lot of time to look up for Python syntax and features on Baidu(I live in China at the moment).  Learned to define class with __str__ as well as __eq__ methods.
